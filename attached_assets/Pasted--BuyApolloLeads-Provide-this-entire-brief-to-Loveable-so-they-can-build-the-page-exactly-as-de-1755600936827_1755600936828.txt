## 1 · Hero Section

**Headline:** *Unlock Premium Apollo Leads in Minutes*
**Sub‑Headline:** *Skip the export limits—get laser‑targeted leads delivered straight to your inbox.*
**Primary CTA Button:** **Order Leads Now**
— place a soft gradient background (sky‑blue → mint) with a subtle abstract illustration of contact cards/leads.

## 2 · Why BuyApolloLeads?

Apollo only lets you export **25 contacts at a time** and caps you at **10 K per month—** forcing hours of manual work or costly enterprise plans.

We leverage a dedicated Apollo partnership that lets us pull leads **in bulk and at wholesale pricing**, then pass those savings on to you.
✅ *Faster:* One link → bulk export.
✅ *Cheaper:* From just **\$10** per 5 K verified emails.
✅ *Flexible:* Packages from 5 K up to 1 M contacts.
